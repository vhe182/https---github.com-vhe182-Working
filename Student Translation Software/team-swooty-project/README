Play with the gram files under demo.sphinx.helloworld

No need to run ant or install ant. We made need to do this at a later time; however, we
are running fine without it for now. 

You WILL need a regular microphone that plugs into the microphone jack onto the computer
you CAN NOT use a webcam microphone (I attempted and failed).

If you are going to delete a line in the hello.gram file please save the line in Temp_Gram.gram
so we don't need to write it out later. If it is already saved feel free to delete.

The program is using a main file so we need to edit this to fit into the MCV model. 

Things to not touch yet: 
helloworld.Manifest
helloworld.config.xml


HOW THE GRAM FILE WORKS

EX1)

(Good morning | Hello) ( Abed | Bhiksha | Evandro | Paul | Philip | Rita | Will )
 
By using the above syntax we can say:

Good morning Abed
Good morning Will
Hello Paul

We cannot say:

Hello
Abed
Will 


EX2)

(We) (Salute) (You)

You can only say:

We salute you

You can't say:

We
You
